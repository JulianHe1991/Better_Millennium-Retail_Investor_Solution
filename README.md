## Overview

The goal to be achieved in this project is to build a comprehensive quantitative model to provide assistance to retail investor. 
This investment assistance tool provides predicitons on market movement on next trading day till next 12 months, recommendations on asset selection, and generation of model portfolios.  

## Business Problem

Trading is hard. It is so hard that 70-80% of investors or traders lose money on average.Acorrding to a study in Brazil at Sao Paulo School of Economics and University of Sao Paulo, only 3% of traders make money and under 1% do better than minimum wage. Specifically in the US, the millenium generation has gradually become the pillar of the society, their desires to become financially sucessful for the future is strong. In fact, we have seen the increasing number of retail investors in the equity market in the past couple of years. The percentage of participation by younger investors has increaed from 10-15% from last decade to approach 25% this year. A great problem to be solves is how to navigate investments accounts for those younger genrations and people who do not have time to invest but expect a decent accumulation on their retirement accounts.

## Data Understanding

We are using multiple datasets for this project.
- In deriving market movement prediction, datasets are companies from S&P daily trading data. Daily return is the target variable.

- For recommendation system, we are using data from Morningstar.
